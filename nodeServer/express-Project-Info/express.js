//Project Two Parts- Fullstack - servoce oriented Architecture

//Part1: <Backend> => node-server(express, nodemon, mongodb  by mongoose, cors=> are packages or modules)
//Part2: - <frontend> => reactapp(webpacl,html5,bootstrap for css, react, redux, react-redux, react-router-dom axi)) 


// Monolithic Architecture: Built on java, .net (front end + backend) Springboot

*WE will be learning the one below

//Service Oriented Architecture: Front end(html,javascript,css(react,angular)) 
//and BAckend(rest apis(spring,mvc, node express)) 


//We will be creating our APIS from restful services

// fs,os,http,etc - built in modules of node framework(99000 packages, cookies)
//npmjs.com // to host packages or modules built in node

//Web Server- Requirements keep changing
//1To host Service - webserver
//2 be able to expose http methods(get,put,post,delete...)-http
//3 be able to handle data types- data-types
//4 be able to handle various authentications - oauthh
//5 be able to handle caching-cookie-parser
//6 be able to handle file types - JSON.parse
//7. Authorization/ cross origin - cors

// express: One common to do all the job a web server should be able to do using node packages - require("express")


//We can Use node.js cli - npm or yarn
//npm -v

//metadata: Information about information : Build it: it is a file: which has information about our packages that are installed
//For this ^ we need to intialize npm in our repository

//Step1: go to folder/directory
//Step2: npm init (to initialize the package with npmjs.com)
//Step3: add information to package.json

//Once package.json is created we can use npm to install external packages with below steps:


//***Node mOn: prevents you from restarting the application over and over again */
/*

install: npm -i <PackageName> - npm i express
un-install: npm uninstall <Package Name> -D
